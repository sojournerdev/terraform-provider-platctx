# PlatCtx Provider Overview

PlatCtx provides a single, typed structure for service metadata that works across cloud providers and modules. Define identity, ownership, environment, and governance once, then pass the result to any downstream module or tool.

## Goals

- One typed structure for service metadata across all providers and modules.
- Validate metadata at the Terraform boundary, before resources are created.
- Produce a canonical form that downstream tools and service catalogs can rely on.
- Pure and deterministic: no network calls, no side effects.

## Non-goals

- Replacing cloud-provider-specific tagging or labeling.
- Managing infrastructure or calling external APIs.
- Enforcing organizational policy. PlatCtx carries facts; policy is the caller's responsibility.

## Compatibility

| Dependency | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Terraform | >= 1.8 |
| OpenTofu | >= 1.8 |
| Go (development) | >= 1.27 |

## Security

- No network requests
- No environment variables read
- No telemetry collected
- No context values logged

All computation is local and deterministic. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/sojournerdev/terraform-provider-platctx/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for the vulnerability disclosure policy.

## Testing

Every release passes these quality gates:

- **Unit tests** with race detector
- **Fuzz tests** for input/output contracts
- **Acceptance tests** via the Terraform Plugin Testing framework
- **Static analysis** via `go vet` and `golangci-lint`
- **Vulnerability scanning** via `govulncheck`
- **Documentation validation** (Markdown lint, spell check, link check)
